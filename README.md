# VAC-Checker
A program to check if accounts have been banned by VAC (Valve Anti Cheat) software. It has been written in python with the aim to connect it to a discord bot.

Currently the bot in private and I will continue to work on this during my free time.


By sending a message to the Discord Bot it will repond with a list of accounts that have been banned. The accounts will also be displayed in the terminal.
